## Run the app
First clone the git repo:
`git clone https://github.com/ya5huk/safe_cloud`

Download the relevant libraries described in `requirements.txt` using `pip`:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Initialize relevant environment variables in a file `.env` (Add the file yourself). The file must include:
- `EMAIL_USERNAME`, the 2step auth sender username
- `EMAIL_PASSWORD`, the 2step auth sender password (Note that this needs to be an [app password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en))
- `IS_IT_A_REAL_EMAIL_API_KEY`, an api key for https://isitarealemail.com/. NOTE that the api does not work consistantly and used more for theoretic-use (Good email validators cost money)

Finally, run the app using
`py app.py` or `python app.py`
and enter `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
